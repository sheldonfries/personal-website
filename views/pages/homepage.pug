            p
              | Goofspiel is a simple card game for two or more players, requiring a certain level of strategy to win. Each player is given one suit from the deck and plays for cards from the Spade suit. The goal of the game is to end up with higher valued cards than your opponent by playing higher ranked cards of your own. Once all 13 Spade cards have been won, the player with the highest point value wins the game.
